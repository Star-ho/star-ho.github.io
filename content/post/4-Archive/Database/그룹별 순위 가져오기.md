가져오는 그룹 컬럼이 1개일떄

```
mysql 5.7
SELECT name, year, month FROM (
  SELECT *, IF(@prev <> name, @rn:=0,@rn), @prev:=name, @rn:=@rn+1 AS rn
  FROM example, (SELECT @rn:=0) rn, (SELECT @prev:='') prev
  ORDER BY name ASC, year DESC, month DESC
) t WHERE rn <= 2;

mysql 8.0 
SELECT name, year, month FROM (
  SELECT name, year, month, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC) AS rn
  FROM example
) t WHERE rn <= 2;
```

    FROM example, (SELECT @rn:=0)rn, (SELECT @prev:='')prev
    ORDER BY name ASC, year DESC, month DESC
)t WHERE rn <= 2;
Using MySQL 8.0 with ROW_NUMBER:

mysql 8.0
SELECT name, year, month FROM (
  SELECT name, year, month, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name, year ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC) AS rn
  FROM example
```
